# Brief Explanation
This project # How to connect your littleBits to Node-RED in IBM Bluemixcontains a sample PHP application that connects to the Watson Personality Insights
service in Bluemix. It is meant as exercise. The PHP file only contains the skeleton explaining
how it could be done. An actual implementation can be found in the 'cheatsheet' folder.

Finally, consider defining some sprints and work items in Track & Plan to give
interested developers a sense of your cadence and upcoming enhancements.
