This project contains a sample PHP application that connects to the Watson Personality Insights
service in Bluemix. It is meant as exercise. The PHP file only contains the skeleton explaining
how it could be done. An actual implementation can be found in the 'cheatsheet' folder.

We have created an empty license.txt file for you. Well, actually, it says,
"<Replace this text with the license you've chosen for your project.>" We
recommend you edit this and include text for license terms under which you're
making your code available. A good resource for open source licenses is the
[Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/).

Be sure to update your project's profile with a short description and
eye-catching graphic.

Finally, consider defining some sprints and work items in Track & Plan to give
interested developers a sense of your cadence and upcoming enhancements.
